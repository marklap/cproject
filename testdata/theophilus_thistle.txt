Theophilus Thistle, the thistle sifter,
In sifting a sieve full of un-sifted thistles,
Thrust three thousand thistles through the thick of his thumb.
Now if Theophilus Thistle, the successful thistle sifter,
Thrustâ€™s three thousand thistles through the thick of his thumb,
Then success to the successful thistle sifter.
